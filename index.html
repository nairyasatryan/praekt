                In the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, Men are given Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them,
                the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, instilling into it a great part of his power, in order to
                  dominate the other Rings so he might conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of Men and Elves battles Sauron's
                  forces in Mordor. Isildur of Gondor severs Sauron's finger and the Ring with it, thereby vanquishing Sauron and
                    returning him to spirit form. With Sauron's first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. The Ring's 
                    influence corrupts Isildur, who takes it for himself and is later killed by Orcs. The Ring is lost in a river 
                    for 2,500 years until it is found by Gollum, who owns it for over four and a half centuries. The ring abandons 
                    Gollum and it is subsequently found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is unaware of its history.
                Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend, the wizard Gandalf
                the Grey. Bilbo departs the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his 
                nephew Frodo. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that Gollum was captured and 
                tortured by Sauron's Orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: "Shire" and "Baggins." Gandalf returns and
                  warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo departs with his friend, gardener Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf rides to 
                  Isengard to meet with the wizard Saruman, but discovers his alliance with Sauron, who has dispatched his nine 
                  undead Nazgûl servants to find Frodo.

              <p class="two_towers">
                Awakening from a dream of Gandalf fighting the Balrog in Moria, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee find themselves
                lost in the Emyn Muil near Mordor and discover they are being tracked by Gollum, a former bearer of the One Ring.
                  Capturing Gollum, Frodo takes pity and allows him to guide them, reminding Sam that they will need Gollum's help
                  to infiltrate Mordor. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue a band of Uruk-hai to save their companions Merry and 
                  Pippin, entering the kingdom of Rohan. The Uruk-hai are ambushed by a group of Rohirrim, allowing the Hobbits 
                  to escape into Fangorn Forest. Meeting Aragorn's group, the Rohirrim's leader Éomer explains that he and his
                    men have been exiled by Rohan's king, Théoden, who is under the control of Saruman and his servant Gríma
                    Wormtongue. Éomer believes Merry and Pippin were killed during the raid but leaves the group two horses.
                      Searching for the Hobbits in Fangorn, Aragorn's group encounters Gandalf, who after his fight against the
                      Balrog was resurrected as Gandalf the White to help save Middle-earth.

                Centuries later, during the War of the Ring, Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Théoden of Rohan to 
                Isengard, where they reunite with Merry and Pippin. Gandalf retrieves Saruman's palantír, and the group returns to 
                Edoras to celebrate their victory at Helm's Deep. Pippin looks into the palantír, seeing Sauron and a burning tree.
                Gandalf deduces that the enemy plans to attack Gondor's capital Minas Tirith; he rides there to warn Gondor's steward
                  Denethor. Pippin, who accompanies him, swears fealty to Denethor, whose now-dead heir Boromir had saved his life;
                  on Gandalf's instruction, he triggers the lighting of the beacons, which call for help from Rohan.
                  Frodo, who carries the Ring, and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor, unaware that Gollum, now their guide, 
                  plans to betray them and take the Ring for himself. The trio witness the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the nine 
                  Nazgûl, setting off towards Gondor with his army of Orcs. Gollum conspires to frame Sam for eating food supplies
                    and desiring the Ring; influenced by the growing power of the Ring, Frodo is taken in by the deception, and orders
                    Sam to go home. Gollum then tricks Frodo into venturing into the lair of the giant spider Shelob. Frodo narrowly
                      escapes and confronts Gollum, who falls down a chasm after a scuffle. Shelob discovers, paralyzes, and binds 
                      Frodo, but is wounded and driven away by a returning Sam, who, mourning Frodo's apparent death, takes the Ring.
                      Sam realizes his mistake when a group of Orcs takes Frodo captive, but manages to rescue Frodo as the Orcs
                        fight among themselves. Now inside Mordor, the hobbits continue towards Mount Doom, their destination.
